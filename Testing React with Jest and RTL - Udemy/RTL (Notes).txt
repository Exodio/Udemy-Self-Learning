React Testing

React Testing Library
- provides virtual DOM for tests

Jest
- finds tests
- runs tests
- determines whether tests pass or fail

Additional clarifications:
- rednder method - creates a virtual DOM for argument JSX
- screen global - access virtual DOM via screen global
- expect - jest global, starts the assertion

React Testing Library helps with:
- rendering components into the virtual DOM
- searching virtual DOM (getByText method example)
- Interacting with virtual DOM
(Although it needs a test runner to find tests, run them, make assertions)
Jest helps by:
- comes with create-react-app
- is also recommended by Testing Library

What is Jest Watch Mode for:
- Watches for changes in files since last commit
- Only run tests related to these files
- No changes? No tests, good

How does Jest work:
- global tests method has two arguments: string description, test function

- What to render -> The smallest component that encompases tests (for example the App)

- Do we need to pass any props, when we render the component -> Depends on the need (for example the options)

- Do we need to wrap in say OrderDetailsProvider -> We need to know if the provider is used, and is it already wrapped in the component.

- Where should the tests go -> Which file should they be put in? Are they unit tests or functional tests? -> This needs to be desided pre-testing

- What to test -> What is the actual behavior you need to know prior testing.

- Do we need to await -> Is there anything async going on in the component.
